Creativity is vital to effective leadership and problem-solving. It is the engine of invention and innovation, entrepreneurship and design. Acting creatively allows us to express our individuality; when directed against humanity’s problems, creativity can be a profoundly valuable force for good. Artistic inquiries are also the lifeblood of the arts. Through the literary, performing, and visual arts, artists enable us to view the world from new and surprising perspectives. The study of the arts therefore broadens our horizons, cultivating empathy and fostering reflection on our common human experience. Engaging directly in the creative arts as an artist provides a unique opportunity for personal expression and self- discovery.",

This sort of inquiry, broadly understood as humanities scholarship, teaches us about the values and perspectives of other cultures while also deepening our understanding of our own. The skills such scholarship requires enable us to gain insight from texts broadly defined - from poems and novels to paintings and plays to histories and myths. Ultimately, these insights allow us to turn our gaze from the past to the present, and to imagine a better future.",

The act of writing helps students build skills of analytical and interpretive argument, become careful and critical readers, practice writing in a variety of genres, and engage in a process of intellectual inquiry and creative expression.
